// Keyboard and mouse as the PC ports play it (the README compares them with the Perfect Dark port). The mouse turns Bond
// and tilts his view by an angle a count, as Perfect Dark's port does (0.055 degrees a count at the default 50%, finer
// as the view zooms), aiming or not, and leaves the crosshair where the stick puts it, at the centre without one, as
// Perfect Dark's port's Locked mouse aim and goldeneye-pc-port's Centred aim have it.
//
// Right click aims without the game's aim mode (R): it shows the crosshair and zooms the weapons that zoom, the wheel
// zooms the sniper rifle and the camera further, and nothing else changes. Aim mode would also stop Bond: the stick
// (W and S) moves its crosshair instead of walking him, C-left and C-right (A and D) lean instead of strafing, and
// C-up and C-down crouch. So the game reads Bond's controls as outside aim mode, and the two things right click wants
// are put back where the game decides them each tick: the crosshair after the game hides it, the zoom where it picks
// the view's. R itself (Left Shift, a pad's R) is still the game's aim mode.
//
// The game's auto-aim (the Auto-Aim option) is off while the mouse plays: outside aim mode it moves the crosshair, and
// where the gun fires, onto a target near the middle of the screen, which takes the aim from the mouse. With a pad, or
// the pointer free, the saved option is as it was.
//
// In the tank, outside aim mode and while the mouse plays, the program makes C-left and C-right (A and D) the stick's
// left and right, as the arrows are, so that WASD drives it: the C-buttons would only swing its turret, a degree a
// tick. The mouse swings the turret and tilts the view instead, since the tank works out Bond's view from its own
// angle and its turret's each tick, after his controls.
//
// The keys and the wheel's actions beyond the N64's buttons (reload, crouch, next and previous weapon) come from the
// program (src/game/mouse_keyboard.cpp), which also puts left click on the pad (fire) and says whether right click is
// held. Invert Mouse Y flips the mouse's up and down for looking and aiming.
//
// On the watch's inventory page, while the mouse plays, the stick (W and S) steps through the items an item a push, and
// held, repeats at a pace that can be read, rather than an item a tick, as the original moves it pushed all the way.
//
// In the front end's folders (file, mission and difficulty select) the mouse moves the menus' own cursor as the stick
// does, its left click selects, since the menus take Z as they take A, and its right click goes back, as B does.
//
// The game calls one of two functions each tick it reads Bond's controls, with the crosshair's input: sub_GAME_7F067F58
// outside aim mode and sub_GAME_7F067FBC in it. Both are patched here to turn the view by the mouse; each passes the
// game's own arguments on as the original does, with the weapon's crosshair and aim speeds.
